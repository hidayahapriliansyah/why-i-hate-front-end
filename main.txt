This is a note that explain why sometime i just get shut the Fck up about front end web. (CSS and JS for styling)

I don't know. Sometime i just code it right away just exactly like what i want, but i don't know that the css is not working like i want.
I try to check my code over and over again, but i don't find anything wrong.
You know? there's no error like you run a program and i really don't like.

Btw, don't take it serious. It just my anger LOL.
Btw, the hate is real hahaha....
